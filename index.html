        this was not supposed to mean much to me<br>
        nothing ever meant anything to me<br>
        then in a quick blink, I was overwhelmed <br>
        my cheeks blushed before creating a grey<br>
        the mirror ask, "how did it get this bad?"<br>
        a smile while my heart fills before busting<br>
        plunge your claws in my chest and pull out gore<br>
        serve me my heart on a silver platter<br>
        I'll devour it and imagine it's yours<br>
        so literal, so darkly humorous <br>
        this is alright, but my desires are wrong<br>
        I smile to you with guts between my teeth<br>
        scarlet stains my blouse, cream seeps from my cuts<br>
        it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts <br>

      i am at a pathetic low, help me <br>
      do it for me — you owe me that — help please <br>
      help me, pull me from the concrete — kiss me <br>
      and be near — reward this death — near to help <br>
      "save me," the words linger on my chapped lips  <br>
      i can feel the heat rise and burn my skin  <br>
      but i willingly seep into the floor <br>
      our eyes meet, i can see you through the glass <br>
      you aren't looking at me , are you? - of course  <br>
      you do not speak much, but i can hear you <br>
      butchered and buried me from a distance <br>
      your seat at the vacant service was bare  <br>
      even after you robbed my life away  <br>
      you didn't think to attend my funeral <br>

    <div class="a">
      the affectionate smiles, laughter, and love<br>
      "This is all a gift for me?" I question<br>
      the earnest screeches, cries, and bites — I blush<br>
      The question is answered, "This is for me."<br>
      art is crooked — was that my painting hung?<br>
      music plays in pieces — that was my song<br>
      you say you don't know me well — then explain<br>
      you were watching me, and you caught my eye<br>
      this is what you wanted — my attention<br>
      this is it — shelter and isolation<br>
      your smiles, your begging, and your attention <br>
      and your laughter, your hatred, and your love<br>
      sing it all out, let it be yours-ours-mine<br>
      confirm my words, "All of this is for you."<br>

        feelings unmatched ideas relentless <br>
        pure yet very much tainted and selfish <br>
        it pains me to see how this all changed me<br>
        at night i imagine gentle touches<br>
        i ve read about this i ve read about us<br>
        a belt against skin is what this feels like<br>
        you can be gentle or rough i-you know<br>
        you d never do anything to hurt me<br>
        i think of this truth with a rosy palm<br>
        and while i study your sleepless patterns<br>
        i ll watch your chest steadily rise and fall<br>
        i picture touching it i desire to<br>
        but for now you slumber in the darkness<br>
        i dream our time to be one will come soon <br>

  <div class="a">
  sit close to me — far away yet still mine<br>
  in my line of sight, yet we do not speak<br>
  alone with coffee as a companion<br>
  the headaches will come back — don't drink that<br>
  don't look away — grin like the time before<br> 
  i want to see that smile again, show me<br>
  this is cruel, spoiled, and endless abuse<br>
  sit closer to me — not like you are now <br>
  turn your phone off — take no more messages<br>
  Be mine, I deserve that much — can't you see<br>
  my devotion is endless, sit closer<br>
  me and you — don't accept anyone else<br>
  i deserve you, you deserve reverence<br>
  be mine like I am yours — fulfill my greed<br>

        I have turned into an obscured monster<br>
        But an odd pleasure washes over me <br>
        dance with me while the Devil admires us<br>
        or I will dance in lonesome forever<br>
        rotten corpse on a string is how I'm seen<br>
        look in my foggy eyes, see how I feel<br>
        Be surprised the truth is not romantic<br>
        You must not weep and whimper for yourself<br>
        look through the foggy window as I watch<br>
        Feel special, dear, this is a compliment <br>
        may God behold our prolonged narrative <br>
        If it rains, we confirm our skill of none<br>
        If it shines, we sit in the drunken dark<br>
        It feels like glass falling out my sore feet<br>

          admire the sky, see how it changes shades<br>
          admire the river, see its constant shift <br>
          admire My love, see it grow day past day <br>
          or you can live your whole life without Us <br>
          philosophers yell the way, why listen <br>
          a scientist yells the truth, why listen <br>
          lovers whisper you odes, why not listen <br>
          navigate past Me, you never noticed <br>
          talk louder than Me, you never perceived <br>
          completely ignore Me, you never knew <br>
